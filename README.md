# DayZ_Server_Setup
Despite the game being made available to the public for a very long time. As we all know, DayZ servers are very difficult to setup. There is not much useful information out on the internet for new people trying to create their own servers. My aim for this repository is to make it easier for people to create their own servers without spending a massive amount of time to figure out common issues. By the end of this, you will have access to all of my pre-configured files and scripts. Keep in mind, because every server is different and everyone has different goals, some of this info may not be suited to fit your needs for your server (I.E. the "types.xml" file, some people may not want certain loot to spawn in certain areas for whatever reason), but it will hopefully take some of the stress off. 

Over time I will be uploading new files and changing current ones.
